## Context
During the fall 2023 (first year of my PhD), I was a teacher assistant a [ISEA Supaero](https://www.isae-supaero.fr), supervising practical sessions and exercice sessions of the automation coursem given by Caroline Berard. This course was given to 4th year students (equivalent to first year of a Master's degree).

## Content of the course 
This courses presented the main concepts of linear automation, starting with remainders on **closed loop systems** and performances such as **stability** and **accuracy**. The courses also presents classical controlers and extends to **Multi-Inputs Multi-Outputs** systems. The concept of **State Space** representation has also been introduced and linked back to transfert functions representations and classical stability and accuracy criterion. 
Along the courses, practical session have been conducted on Matlab and Simulink, allowing the students to observe and verify the theorical results that have been presented.
