## Context
During the fall 2023 (first year of my PhD), I had the opportunity to co-supervise (with [Vincent Bonnet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-david-bonnet/?originalSubdomain=fr)) practical sessions of the courses *Introduction to robotics* and *Advanced robotics* at the [University Institute of Technology of Toulouse (IUT)](https://iut.univ-tlse3.fr/genie-electrique-informatique-industrielle). Students where respectively in their second and third years of higher education with majors in electrical engineering and Industrial Information (GEII).

## Content of the course 
### Introduction to robotics
This course was mainly organised around the simulator Copelliasim in order to introduce the classical modelisation of robots. A python interface has also been introduced to the students along with methods and good practices to control robots.

### Advanced to robotics
This courses takes place a year after the first one and reuses the concept previously introduced. It aims at going further into the understanding of the motion of robots. The notions of **direct geometric model**, **inverse geometric model**, **direct forward kinematics** and **inverse forward kinematics** are specifically developped along with methods for computing reference trajectories and calibrating robot.
This courses ends with a longer project where students can work on robots *Staubli*, *Kuka* and *Scara*.
