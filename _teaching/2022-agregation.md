From September 2021 to June 2022, I prepared at ENS Paris Saclay for a prestigious french competitive examination for teachers, called 'agrégation'. I was a candidate in engineering science with a specialisation in computer science. I was ranked first nation-wide for the 2022 session of this examination, allowing me to apply for a teacher position in higher education.
